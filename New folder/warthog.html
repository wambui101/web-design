<p>The desert Warthog is a memeber of the pig family. It has a large, warty head, a coarse man, and two pairs of tusks. Unlike the coomon warthog, wwhich can be found across most of Africa, the desert warthog only lives in Kenya, Ethopia, and Somalia. It lives in the savannah and shrubland habitats,where it feeds on grass and other vegetation and uses its abandoned and very dark burrows as a place of shelter.</p>

<p> The desert warthog is listed by the IUCN as least concern. However, the population faces several risks in Kenya, including growing human and livestock numbers. This increases competition for both water and food.</p>
