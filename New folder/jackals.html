<p> The black-backed jackal is a member of the dog family. It has a rusty red coat with a black patch on its back and a black tipped tail. it measures around 95 centimeters (37 inches) from head to tail.</p>

<p> As opportunistic omnivores, jackals eat what they can .they work in family packs to hunt small Antelopes, but they'll also feed on reptiles, insects, birds, fruits, berries, and carcasses left by large predators.</p>

<p> These animals live in a wide variety of habitats, from deserts to grasslands to savannahs. The IUCN lists black-backed jackals as least concern, meaning they face few threats. However, they are hunted by farmers ho kill them to protect their livestock.</p>
